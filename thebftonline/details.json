            "content": "Meridian Port Service (MPS) reached a new level of container-handling productivity on vessels by exceeding the previous record of 112 moves/hour which was achieved on MSC ALTAIR that berthed at Terminal 3 on May 15, 2020.\nThe new vessel productivity record of 139.91 moves/hour on MSC Livorno is from first lift to last lift, and operationally recognised as 145.86 moves/hour after adjusting the permissible deductible times. This has so far been logged as the All-Time Record for Tema Port, and is certainly by far best on the West African Coastline.\nMSC Livorno is flying the German Flag and is among a fleet of Ultra Large Container Vessels (ULCV) deployed on the MSC Africa Express (AFEX) weekly service into Ghana. Her capacity is 14,000 TEUs and Gross Tonnage of 153,115. Her length overall (LOA) is 366 metres and she is 51 metres wide.\nChief Execitive Officer of MPS Mohamed Samara remarked: \u201cIt has been identified by trade experts that one of the key factors for realising the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) vision is development of significant trade and transport infrastructure.\n\u201cMPS Terminal 3 is first among these infrastructures: our progressive service efficiency to shippers and consignees as well as superb vessels\u2019 productivity levels have resulted in direct vessel calls with deep-drafted vessels (avoiding hubs), hence shorter transit times.\u201d\nWith MPS Terminal 3 positioning itself as an effective transhipment hub providing connectivity between the seaports of Africa and hinterland markets, Ghana through this will be at the lead for Africa in reducing to the barest minimum existing intra-continental trade barriers. This will boost economic development and fit the continent to harness all the diversified economic benefits inherent in the AfCFTA.\nHe described the recent record-breaking accomplishment as a stellar performance by the operations team. \u201cWe are proud to achieve this milestone with no incidents or accidents, respecting all safety protocols, and for creating a worthy safety culture that safeguards all workers and company assets.\n\u201cOn behalf of the shareholders, board and management of MPS, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the entire MPS team, especially the operations management, supervisors, planners, equipment & crane operators, truck drivers and all the support team that worked on the vessel,\u201d said Mr. Samara.",

            "content": "With the right reform in our agricultural sector, we can grow the economy, create more jobs and attain food security. And while government has achieved and continues to achieve significant gains toward this vision, we can\u2019t do it alone; but we need to ensure these partnerships are fit for purpose and make sense for the country.\nAn example of this is our partnership with AGRA, who has supported us to improve the enabling environment for smallholder farmers, while delivering the technical and structural reforms needed to help grow agricultural sector.\nAGRA arrived in Ghana in 2006, and during its first decade, it invested US$12.8million in our national agricultural sector. That this has borne fruit can be established by looking at some of the results of this investment.\nThe establishment of 11 seed companies has been supported, as was the development and release of 45 seed varieties, of which 36 went on to be commercially developed. AGRA helped 20 people achieve PHDs and 27 to be awarded MSCs.\nIt trained 4,132 agricultural dealers, which meant the distances farmers had to travel to get access to inputs, such as seeds and fertiliser were reduced. It educated 702,000 farmers on the techniques of Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM), a process that mixes mineral and organic fertilisers and aims to maximise the utility of scarce nutrient resources.\nAs a result, 212,000 hectares have been cropped using ISFM technologies. AGRA\u2019s intervention has resulted in 122,000 metric tonnes of harvests commercially gathered in, valued at US$23million.\nAGRA contributed to the development and passage through the political process of regulations connected with the Plants and Fertiliser Act, a measure to ensure the efficient conduct of plant protection, to prevent the introduction and spread of plant pests, to regulate the import, and facilitate the export of plants and plant materials.\nIt contributed also to Ghana\u2019s National Fertiliser Policy, and promoted the Seed (Certification and Standard) Regulation, which has been passed by Ghana\u2019s Parliament.\nAll of this is of critical importance in a country where half the people reading this article work in agriculture. We cannot underestimate the challenge of enhancing a sector that accounts for more than half our gross domestic product.\nAGRA\u2019s initiatives are in no sense in competition with official government policy. On the contrary, its work has been fully in line with the state\u2019s two main programmes in this sector, the Food and Agriculture Sector Development Policy (FASDEP II) and the second phase of the Medium Term Agriculture Sector Investment Plan (METASIP II).\nLike government, AGRA is committed to increasing incentives for private-sector investment and participation in agriculture, while improving access for Ghanaian farmers to both finance and markets. We are both committed to encouraging the adoption of climate-smart technologies and the use of climate-adapted seeds and fertilisers.\nAGRA has improved the incomes and the food security of at least 1.2million smallholder households, and has facilitated the development of a \u2018smart subsidy\u2019 model to encourage the adoption of yield-enhancing technologies.\nOn the ground, 1,880 village-based advisers have been recruited and trained, and a partnership established to implement the National Rice Development Strategy \u2013 aimed at increasing the capacity of more than 128,000 farmers.\nAGRA\u2019s work takes it into many and complex areas, but its rationale is quite simple. It is to transform the working lives of primarily smallholder farmers \u2013 men and women typically cultivating staple crops on land measuring two hectares or less, by turning what had been a daily struggle, to survive into a thriving small business. In this fine and praiseworthy endeavour, AGRA has been a true friend to Ghana.\n\u00a0\nDr. Owusu Afriyie Akoto\n is Minister of Food and Agriculture",

Her Gross Tonnage is 141,649 tonnes with container capacity of 13,556 TEUs. She is one of 15 vessels operated by MSC on this Far East-West Africa weekly service that enjoys a berthing window arrangement at MPS\u2019 Terminal 3.\nT\nranshipment at the centre of the world\nIt was in 1884 that the Greenwich Meridian was established at the International Meridian Conference held in October 1884 at Washington, D.C., as the line of zero Longitude, forming the basis for navigation and time-keeping throughout the world.\nRunning from the North to the South Pole and separating the Eastern Hemisphere from the Western, this Prime Meridian Line (0\u00b0 E/W) passes through the centre of the Harbour Basin of MPS Terminal 3 at Tema Port, which is the closest point on Earth to the Centre of the World \u2013 where the Greenwich Meridian Line (zero-degree longitude) crosses with the Equator Line (zero-degree latitude).\nMPS, by virtue of its location at the centre of the world as well as its commitment to continuous improvement in infrastructure, superstructure and the service levels, provides stakeholders the best of the world\u2019s technology to boost its operations.\nFurthermore, it superb investment in creating valuable opportunity to the shipping lines has been put to good use in connecting continents and effectively serving markets, thanks to the enabling infra & superstructure of MPS Terminal 3.\nChief Executive Officer of MPS, Mohamed Samara, mentioned some of the key developments at MPS Terminal 3 that led to Port Tema attaining the status of a shipping hub: \u201cThe efficiency, accessibility, the short waiting time at anchorage, fast vessel turnaround time, higher port capacity and berth availability are the optimal criteria for making Terminal 3 a hub on the west coastline of Africa. Moreover, MPS Terminal m3 has the best synchronised frequency of calls (berthing Windows), number of shipping lines and highest volume per vessel call in West Africa, making it the ideal first port of call with the shortest trade transit time and transhipment facilities,\u201d said Mr Samara.\nMeridian Port Services Limited\n (MPS) is a joint venture between the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority and Meridian Port Holdings Limited, with Bollor\u00e9 Transport & Logistics and APM Terminals. MPS is the region\u2019s most efficient Container Terminal, providing shipping lines with the highest productivity levels (discharge/load), with a real-time electronic data interchange using top-notch Terminal Operating Systems\n.",

Having had the rare privilege of meeting her a few years ago, I have witnessed first-hand her brilliance, tenacity and passion for Africa\u2019s growth. \u00a0A woman of many firsts, her rise didn\u2019t occur by mere happenstance.\nIn a world where women are sidelined and overlooked, she has had to \u2018fight\u2019\u2019 her way through. Having spent a 25-year career at the\u00a0World Bank as a development economist, she was the first woman to run for presidency at the World Bank. She also served two terms as\u00a0Finance Minister of Nigeria\u00a0under President Olusegun Obasanjo and President Good Luck Jonathan respectively.\nShe was the first woman to serve as the country\u2019s finance minister, the first woman to serve in that office twice, and the only finance minister to have served under two different presidents. In 2005, she was named \u2018Global Finance Minister of the Year\u2019 by Euromoney.\nOftentimes, women have faced a lot of criticism and backlash in business and leadership simply because they are women \u2013 and it gets even worse when they are women of colour. Women face a lot of stereotypes when they take on leadership positions. They face varying challenges including lack of support and intimidation. Okonjo-Iweala\u2019s story is no different. Several attempts were made by certain factions to thwart her candidacy for the top job at the WTO; her credibility was questioned, and her capabilities undermined.\nVice President Kamala Harris\u2019 candidacy was also questioned and even ridiculed at several points during the US presidential campaign trail. From snide and unsavory remarks about her identity and competence, Harris \u2013 America\u2019s highest-ranking female official in U.S. history and the first African-American and Asian-American Vice President \u2013 has also been a victim of racism and injustice. Despite these challenges their feats have brought hope to many people, especially young women and girls across the world, to dream and believe it\u2019s possible.\nThere is a need for more women to assume leadership roles to build a stronger post-pandemic world. According to U.N. Women, only 22 countries have an elected woman head of state or government, while 119 nations have never had a woman leader.\nData also indicate that at the current rate, parity will not be reached in national parliaments before 2063, and in ministerial positions before 2077. At the beginning of 2020, only 14 countries had Cabinets\u00a0in which women held at least half the posts. They included Rwanda, Finland, Canada, Colombia and Peru. Currently, America\u2019s Cabinet is one of the most diversified and gender balanced.\nIn an article published by the World Economic Forum, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka \u2013 who made history as South Africa\u2019s first female deputy president in 2005 \u2013 noted that gender-balanced Cabinets made better decisions not just for women but society as a whole.\nIt is sad that even in these modern times, women continue to face social injustices, racism, sexism, cultural appropriation, micro-aggression, gender inequality, entrenched social norms, police brutality among others. Many African women and those within the BAME community and other \u2018minorities\u2019 have experienced several incidences of discrimination, and have been denied access to a lot of opportunities simply because of the colour of their skin.\nThe issue of diversity and inclusion has become an all-important discussion as the world intensifies efforts in the fight against gender disparity and inequality. While I was undertaking my MSc in Biotechnology a few years ago, I observed a very worrying trend \u2013 my experience in academia mirrored my experience in the corporate world to a large extent.\nOn several occasions, I have found myself as one of the few women in the room \u2013 a bad narrative that needs to be challenged.\nRegrettably, the level of women\u2019s representation across the sub-Saharan region is still at an all-time low. While the region has seen an increase in the representation of women in certain fields, they are yet to break through in certain areas that are widely seen as male-dominated sectors.\nGrowing backlashes and the many other barriers women face in leadership, governance, politics etc. continue to pose serious challenges. It is a normal occurrence for men to be considered for managerial positions as against women.\nPredominantly, this is as a result of discriminatory social norms which have tended to be informed by perceptions of leadership being considered as solely reserved for men. These norms continue to shape organisational cultures and practices. Additionally, many women face challenges balancing their work with other responsibilities; and in some situations, some have been forced to choose their family \u2013 causing implications for their prospects of career progression.\nIn the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have witnessed the immense contributions women have made toward combatting the pandemic\u2019s ravaging effects. New Zealand\u2019s Jacinda Ardern and Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel have received worldwide praise for their approach and response to managing the COVID-19 crisis.\nThe crisis underscored the essence of their contributions and the disproportionate burdens women face. Undoubtedly, women leaders have demonstrated their capacity to effectively lead in the COVID-19 response and recovery efforts worldwide. The pandemic has also highlighted the role of women leadership in promoting the diversity and inclusion agenda toward developing an effective pandemic response approach.\nThis will help us re-emphasise the importance of advancing women\u2019s leadership and participation in decision-making as a key component to advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially in addressing the potential long-term effects of COVID-19.\nMore women need to be given the opportunity to lead, take charge and build a more resilient world \u2013 especially in these times. We need to steer conversations targetted at promoting women empowerment, women inclusivity and leadership. Diversity and inclusion have proven to be key drivers for sustainable growth and the game-changer for a well-functioning market economy.\nWe need to position women in diverse business ecosystems to gain access to opportunities, access finance and assets, establish and lead businesses, and participate in critical decision-making processes. As stakeholders, the duty lies on us to discuss practical strategies that can enhance women inclusivity within Africa and beyond.\nThere is a need for inclusive participation by policymakers, civil society, activists, academia and other stakeholders to contribute in achieving gender equality and women empowerment, both locally and internationally.\u00a0 The Commission on the Status of Women, dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women, will be hosting its sixty-fifth session to discuss the theme of how women can actively participate in decision-making and work toward eliminating violence against women and girls.\nHow can women secure meaningful representation, participation and leadership across multiple challenging sectors in this increasingly uncertain world? How can we as stakeholders change the narrative and advocate for a more equitable future and inclusive world?\nCountries need to make room for women to take up more leadership roles by introducing quotas for more female representation. Getting more women involved will make a huge difference. Having a more gender-balanced government will promote inclusive growth.\nGovernments need to criminalise violence against women and impose sanctions against perpetrators of such crimes. According to a 2016 study, four in five women parliamentarians have experienced psychological violence linked to their job; one in four physical violence; and one in five sexual violence.\nRecently, Aargauer Zeitung suffered an intense backlash when it published a derogatory article about Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala in its newspaper. The newspaper was forced to retract its statement when the UN Women Leaders and 124 Ambassadors in Geneva signed a petition on calling out the racist and sexist remarks made by the newspaper. We need to hold people accountable for their actions, and the media, especially, has a duty of care to project the right information to the world.\nRoundtable discussions for women leaders to share their experiences, perspectives and expertise can help in building more inclusive post-COVID-19 economies. Finally, it is vital for us to show support, collaborate and celebrate the tremendous efforts and accomplishments by other women across the globe. Only then can we see the progress we need. A challenged world is an alert world. Collectively we can achieve more.\n>>>\nRoberta Annan is the Founder & Managing Partner of Annan Capital Partners, a sector agnostic specialized boutique investment and advisory firm in sub-Saharan Africa.

            "content": "\u2013 is it time for Ghana to consider?\nReports from the USA state that, shipping lines Hapag-Lloyd and CMA CGM are set to face the findings of a US Federal Maritime Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) probe into congestion fees that liner operators have begun charging shippers.\nThe Commission announced in a post on 4\nth\n August 2021 (\nwww.fmc.gov\n), that it was requesting documentation from eight companies to see if new fees charged ostensibly due to congestion were implemented properly. They stated that \u201c\nThe Federal Maritime Commission has launched an expedited inquiry into the timing and legal sufficiency of ocean carrier practices with respect to certain surcharges\n\u201d.\nThe report in TradeWinds (an international maritime publication) stated that the some of the other liners targeted are HMM, Matson, Mediterranean Shipping Co, Orient Overseas Container Line, SM Line and Zim. The liners were given until 13\nth\n August 2021 to submit documentation to the Commission.\nThe Commission chairman Daniel Maffei said the agency had been hearing about new, unexpected fees being charged by liners.\n\u201c\nIt seems to me that these factors would already have been included into the record-high rates charged by the carriers\n,\u201d he said in a statement.\nThe Commission is responsible with regulating shipping in accordance with the US Shipping Act and has launched several initiatives following the 9\nth\n July 2021 executive order from President Joe Biden on competitiveness in the US economy.\nThe eight companies called upon to answer to the Commission differ from the nine the watchdog announced in July 2021 that it would be auditing for detention and demurrage practices.\nThe above process is something that may have to be considered by the Ghanaian authorities.\u00a0There have been consistent complaints from Ghanaian shippers, freight forwarder and agents over cost and surcharges at the Ghanaian ports.\nMSC, CMA CGM, Hapag-Lloyd and HMM are involved in both probes in the USA, with AP Moller-Maersk, Cosco, Ocean Network Express, Evergreen and Yang Ming also included in the probe by the Commission.\nIn a statement to TradeWinds, Hapag-Lloyd said the current sky-high freight rates were the result of \u201c\nexceptionally strong demand\n\u201d from the US, plus from infrastructure bottlenecks across the supply chain.\n\u201c\nWe are doing everything in our power to cope with this strong demand, to provide additional transport capacity and to meet the needs of our customers\n,\u201d the company said.\n\u201c\nAt the same time, these inefficiencies cause additional costs and remain a burden for all market participants, including the carriers\n.\u201d\nThe German company said it always complies \u201c\nwith filing requirements as defined by relevant authorities\n\u201d.\nThe French shipping giant CMA CGM said it is fully complying with the Commission and would \u201c\nprovide them with all relevant information\n\u201d.\nIn addition to the probe and the congestion fee investigation, the Commission has asked for more powers and changes to laws to make it easier for shippers to bring complaints against liners, and it has executed a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust division.\nGhanaian industry players have long since challenged the legitimacy of these \u201carbitrary\u201d surcharges. Clients have cited ongoing service delays, container shortages and punitive surcharges as having emerged in the current market.\nIt may be time for the shipping authorities and regulators in Ghana to also consider such measures as been investigated by the Commission in the USA. It is evident that efforts should be made to assist shippers in Ghana to better understand and challenge any fees that are imposed by shipping lines locally.\nThe writer is the Managing Partner\u00a0Asare Barimah & Associates\u00a0,Maritime and Oil & Gas Specialist\n[email\u00a0protected]\n\u00a0",

            "content": "To enhance the delivery of quality and innovative tertiary education, Data Link Institute of Business and Technology is set to deepen its partnerships and collaborations with institutions, both local and international.\nThis, according to the President of the institute, Professor Smile Gavua Dzisi is to enhance academic and research cooperation, capacity building and exchange of experiences, information and best practices.\nThe institute, which is currently is in collaboration with four international universities and affiliated to two major universities locally, including Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) and University of Development Studies, Tamale, is also set to be affiliated to the University of Education, Winneba.\nProf Dzisi, speaking at the latest matriculation ceremony of the institute on Friday in Tema revealed that these partnerships and collaborations are yielding fruitful results and providing opportunities to both lecturers and students to enhance their teaching and learning in the institute and increase their employability as well.\n\u201cIn our quest to become of one of the best private academic institutions in the world, the institute continues to collaborate with highly rated universities and other institutions of higher learning across the globe and these efforts are beginning to yield very promising results.\nThese international partnerships and the exchanges are excellent opportunities for students to enrich their educational path and increase their employability.
