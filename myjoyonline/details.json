            "content": "Sports Minister, Mustapha Ussif, has claimed that Ghana is receiving great plaudits for their organisation of the ongoing African Games. \nHe made the revelation at a press briefing on Monday evening where he addressed issues emanating from the games. \n\u201cEvery international official that we have engaged is applauding us for hosting spectacular games so far. So let\u2019s all embrace and position Ghana as a sports destination,\" he said.\n\"There are a lot of positives that we can talk about. Let\u2019s focus on them,\" he concluded by urging the media to focus on the positives. \nGhana has claimed four medals in the games so far, both coming on Sunday, when Winnifred Ntumi won a gold and two silver medals in the weightlifting, while Abeku Jackson added a silver in the swimming.\nIt moved the country into the top 10 in the medal table after seven days of competition. \nBut despite the minimal success in competition, the games have markedly been fraught with many problems.\nBadminton player, Leslie Addo, revealed he and his teammates were transported to the competition on \nthe bucket of a pick up truck\n, while another cyclist revealed he did not receive new equipment for competition, after his old bicycle broke down only a few minutes after the race start. \nGhana has invested $195 million on infrastructure to host the games, with another $47 million earmarked for operations during the competition which will run from March 8-23, 2024.

Our political leaders must prioritise policies that will transform our industrial landscape, attract investments, and harness the talents and resources of our people.\"\nMr Adom echoed these sentiments, pointing out that the manufacturing sector, in particular, holds immense promise for Ghana's economic advancement.\n\"As a representative of the private sector, I can attest to the untapped potential within our manufacturing industry. We need innovative policies that support local industries, encourage value addition, and promote exports,\" he stated.\nBoth leaders emphasised the need for policies that address challenges such as access to finance for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), reliable energy supply, infrastructure development, and skills training to build a competent workforce.\n\"Political parties must move beyond rhetoric and provide clear, actionable plans for Ghana's industrial revolution,\" Dr Sogbey urged. \"This includes fostering partnerships between the public and private sectors, leveraging technology for efficiency, and creating an enabling environment for businesses to thrive.\"\nMr Adom further highlighted the role of sustainable practices in Ghana's industrial growth, stating, \"We cannot overlook the importance of environmentally friendly practices. Our policies must align with global standards for sustainability, ensuring that our industrialization efforts do not compromise the future of our planet.\"\nThe ADC President and AGATEX Paint CEO expressed readiness to collaborate with political parties, offering expertise and insights to develop policies that will drive Ghana's industrial transformation.\nAs Ghana prepares for the 2024 general elections, Dr Bright Atsu Sogbey and Mr Stephen Adom's call serves as a poignant reminder of the pressing need for visionary, practical-oriented industrial revolutionary policies to propel the nation towards a brighter and more prosperous future.\nThe eyes of the nation now turn to the political parties, awaiting their response and commitment to this crucial cause.\nIn response, the Volta Regional Chairman of the NDC, Mawutor Agbavitor noted that the NDC as a party has industrialization as one of their priority areas and plans to make it work to create more jobs.\nMr Mawutor Agbavitor commended the team for their efforts in helping with Ghana's industrialization and also urged them to do their best at making their votes count in the upcoming elections.",

            "content": "Today many of us woke up to celebrate Ghana\u2019s Independence Day: 06.03.57. \n\u201cGod bless our homeland Ghana and make \nour nation great and strong, Bold to defend forever the cause of Freedom and of Right\u201d\n. However this year, so close to the next set of elections, which are bound to change the \u201c\nmandems\n\u201d, there was a distinct sense of a need to identify why Ghana\u2019s independence feels so different on its 67\nth\n birthday. A day of just celebration without reflection appeared awkward and unnatural this year. \u00a0Social media today certainly appears to support a deeper inflection.\nIndependence was hard fought in treachery, in prison cells, in blood and politically with Kwame Nkrumah emerging as the new Prime Minister of Ghana or as reported in the press of the time, the first \u201c\nAfrican Prime Minister of an African Colony\n\u201d, after the success of his CPP at the polls. The bloodshed of 1948, when Ghanaian World War II veterans seeking compensation for their war service were gunned down by the Colonial Police force in Accra, certainly galvanized the desire to be rid of an oppressor. So too the apartheid-style policies pursued by the British in restricting the access of Africans to certain neighborhoods. Gradual \u201c\nconcessions\n\u201d in respect of local governance (local and district councils) by the oppressor from 1951, when Kwame Nkrumah marched out of Jamestown Fort, started this \u201c\njourney\n\u201d towards independence.\nAfter centuries of wrangling with disingenuous foreign parties from the Portuguese in 1482, through the Dutch, Swedes, Danes to the British - who in 1821 \u201c\nestablished\n\u201d the Gold Coast colony, before going on to conquer other groups and \u201c\npurchase\n\u201d lands, not from Africans, but from the Dutch and Danes - the Ghanaian African finally had a \u201c\ngeographical space\u201d \nfrom which to operate, free in theory from the parliamentary reach of the UK\n.\nThe independence day that we celebrate as Ghanaians is the day that the Ghana Independence Act 1957 came into effect \u201c\nto make provision for\u2026..the attainment by Gold Coast of fully responsible status within the British Commonwealth of Nations.\u201d\n This was a 5-section, 2 schedule, and 8-page Act of the British Parliament, which Act had received Queen Elizabeth II assent on 07.02.57, and sought to cobble together the formerly exploited territories of Gold Coast, Ashanti, the northern territories and British Togoland \u2013 the latter taken from the Germans after WW1 in 1918 \u2013 under the name Ghana.\nIn many respects, the 6\nth\n March 1957 was not independence day, but an \u201c\nonboarding day towards potential full nationhood\n\u201d to the extent that a significant minority of the inhabitants of British Togoland did not want to become nationals of Ghana, and to the extent that it was possible to thrive as the only African country within the \n\u201cBritish Commonwealth of Nations\u201d\n under the British Monarch. The Notting Hill riots of 29\nth\n August through to 5\nth\n September 1958 were demonstrative of the prevailing attitudes of the day towards race.\nIt was Parliament that was to be trusted with Ghana\u2019s development, and it was not until 01.07.60 that Ghana became a Republic \u2013 severing links to the UK - with Kwame Nkrumah as President.\nThat is not to say that the Ghana Independence Act 1957 was not significant. It was. Its key obsession was to establish the Ghanaian Parliament as the sole legislative authority of the land: No act of the UK Parliament passed on or after 06.03.57 could extend to Ghana, the UK Government had no responsibility for the government of Ghana, the Ghanaian Parliament had full power to make laws \u2013 even laws that were \u201c\nrepugnant to the law of England\n\u201d \u2013 previously made unlawful by the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865. The loss of British nationality and access to \u201c\nbenefits\n\u201d from the \u201cColonial Development and welfare\u201d fund were byproducts of independence. \u00a0\u00a0\nTo say that Ghanaian independence was seen by many Europeans as an experiment to establish whether Africans could establish stable, democratic and independent states is an understatement. Whilst \n\u201cSalute to a new nation\u201d\n was its headline, the Daily Mirror of Wednesday 06.03.57,on page 7, ran a photograph of dancing ladies under the headline\n \u201cThis is how they do the highlife\u201d\n. \u00a0\nEven then in 1957 and hidden from view, the waters were not calm, despite the photographs of women in elegant white gloves twisting through the night. How long the dance continued is a matter of some debate. But Ghana\u2019s first - off dance floor - fights were arguably with itself, through its politicians.\nThe promulgation of the Preventive Detention Act 1958, an act which made lawful the detention without trial for five years (later extended to 10 years in 1959 then indefinitely) and without right of appeal for conduct considered by the government to be prejudicial to the defence and security of Ghana, probably best illustrates the tense political atmosphere. The de-stooling of anti-Nkrumah chiefs soon after independence and / or Dr Busia the leader of the opposition\u2019s exile in 1957 cannot have been a great look to any well-wishing observer of the new nation.\nThe lead up to the 6\nth\n March 2024 has not been great either: Ghana\u2019s sense of financial independence has taken a battering, its return to the IMF is yet to yield, especially juxtaposed against Ghana\u2019s strong oratorial performances at podiums, and the \u201c\nissue with the bonds\n\u201d continues as a weeping wound. Further, to some, the notion of Ghana beyond aid is well and truly buried, the stone from Israel will not found a national cathedral designed by Ghana\u2019s own world celebrated architect and economic data points remain contentious in differing from the lived experience.\nIt was therefore of note that it was Ghana\u2019s Parliament, and not its government, that this week drew undoubtedly negative international attention to Ghana and has sought to test the tensile strength of Ghana\u2019s independence. In the week of its independence, Ghana appeared to spin unnecessarily away from reason, when its usually divided Parliament passed a bipartisan bill, unusually named the Proper Human Sexual Rights and Ghanaian Family Values Bill (\u201cPHSRGFVB\u201d to those who take umbrage with the acronym LGBTQIA+), itself the antithesis to the defence of \u201c\nthe cause of freedom and of right\n\u201d. \u00a0Views on the Bill amongst Ghanaians differ wildly, but there can be little doubt that \nGhana\u2019s Parliament has placed an independence bomb on the President\u2019s desk, with the Supreme Court being called on to, hopefully, act as the bomb disposal unit\n. There can also be little doubt that Ghana\u2019s independence, in the most obvious and original sense of being empowered to pass its own laws, is under enormous pressure following the strident announcement by valued foreign \n\u201cpartners and friends\u201d\n of Ghana of the withdrawal of cold cash / investment, if the President signs the Bill into law.\nEmpowering Ghana\u2019s Parliament, section 2 of the first Schedule of the Ghana Independence Act, 1957 provided, as follows:\n\u201cNo law and no provision of any law made on or after the appointed day by the Parliament of Ghana shall be void or inoperative on the ground that it is repugnant to the law of England, or to the provisions of any existing or future Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\u201d\nThe PHSRGFVB is obviously \n\u201crepugnant\u201d\n to the UK\u2019s Equality Act 2010, which enshrines the rights of the LGBTQ community not to suffer discrimination in employment, education, public services etc. \u00a0Post 1957 independence, the comparative exercise to the laws of England no longer matters in assessing the legality of Ghana law. This is great. However, it is through the comparative exercise to those rights that Ghana collectively values, as enshrined in the articles of its 1992 Constitution, that Ghana will best be able to demonstrate the strength of her independence in 2024.\nJust as the international community looked on to see if an African Colony would be run by Africans, so Ghanaians and their well-wishers will look on to see how Ghana protects its independence. The 1992 Constitution contains express provisions on the process to be followed once Parliament presents a bill for signature by the President and what occurs if the President refuses to sign the bill (see art 106(7) to (10) of the Constitution). The Constitution also contains fundamental rights and balances between the powers of Parliament, the Executive and the judiciary. All three are scheduled to meet in the Supreme Court and a constitutional resolution will be Ghana\u2019s best 67\nth\n birthday present. A grab for cash dangled by foreign partners will not satisfy those interested in the continued building of the nation!\nKwame Nkrumah inspired Ghana\u2019s / Africa\u2019s independence movement, became a dictator and was then overthrown. Ghana has been building on its independence since and somewhere along its journey, the importance of strong institutions of state has emerged.\n\u201cFill our hearts with true humility,\nMake us cherish fearless honesty\u2026.\u201d\nWe still can.\nKweku Aggrey-Orleans\n06.03.24",

            "content": "Ghanaian film critic, Tony Asankomah, has broached the topic of film distribution in Ghana\u00a0and its concomitant effects.\nIn a recent interview on \nJoy FM\n\u2019s \nShowbiz A-Z\n he attributed the lower visibility of Ghanaian films on Netflix to distribution gap.\u00a0\n\u201cA lot goes into it, talking about the quality and the standards, the requirements that they need to enable you get your film onto Netflix. But I have maintained and I am saying this that, our biggest problem as a space is because we do not have Ghanaian distributors who understand the terrain for distribution of films now.\nSo all the Ghanaian films that you see on Netflix, they didn\u2019t get there by chance. They went through a distributor who could be a Nigerian or South African company who understands the model and these distribution companies always have a quota of films they have to submit. So of course, I am from this country, I would prioritize content coming from my country that content coming from Ghana,\" he told the host Kwame Dadzie.\nHe emphasised that he had seen some very good Ghanaian films that could not make it through to Netflix because of the distributor they dealt with, and he was also privy to some very horrible films from different parts of the world ended up on Netflix.\nHe also touched on the business of demand meeting supply, as one of the reasons there are not many Ghanaian movies on Netflix. \n\u201cWe have come to understand how Nigerians paying for subscription. So if Netflix is paying for their data they know where the money is coming from. They know those who are paying more for subscription. They will entertain them. They look at the analytics and know the type of films they watch, these are the kind of content they are interested in,\" he said. \nNetflix is an American subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service that primarily distributes original and acquired films and television shows from various genres, and it is available internationally in multiple languages.\nSome Ghanaian films on Netflix are 'The Burial of Kojo', 'Keteke', 'Azali', 'Gold Coast Lounge', 'Side Chic Gang', 'Aloe Vera', 'Ties That Bind', among others.

These attract a majority of our people in our society and also have more effect on them,\" he the host Kwame Dadzie.\nHe also noted that to be able to market Ghana to the world like Hollywood has done to America, Ghanaian film makers need depict real lifestyle of the people to the world.\nHe said that regardless of the fact that society has become global and there is an inclination towards acculturation, there should be a deliberate attempt to project the Ghanaian culture.\u00a0\nThe legendary movie producer further stated that regardless of the myriad of problems facing the Ghanaian movie industry, there are prospects. \n\"Although I am not happy about the quality of most of these productions, I know that Rome was not built in a day.\u00a0\u00a0Modern production is now finding its way into the African industry and the industry is now being built. We must work hard towards it,\" he said. \nIn their bid to maximise their potentials in the industry, King Ampaw also advised film makers in Ghana not to bank their hopes on government\u2019s financial aid for their movie productions.\nAccording to King who is popularly known for the 1983 movie \u2018Kukurantumi: Road to Accra\u2019, funds provided by governments for film productions usually don\u2019t suffice for the real work.\n\"Actually, to put the facts down, commercial productions have got very little, not much to do with government. It is purely private business because of the money involved,\" he said.\nKing said the government can only give those funds which will cushion film makers but for a full production they need more than the government fund can support.\n\"Unfortunately, the young people here have been emphasising it most times. I think that has made us a little bit lazy.\nAfter all, how much money can the government give to the so many film makers? Now, listen to this, the whole government film fund, I may use it for only one movie production. We might have to change our attitude and minds on that,\" he said.\nKing Ampaw is famed for movies such as \nThey Call it Love, Kukurantumi, Road to Accra, Juju (Nana Akoto), No Time to Die\n, among others.

By prioritizing clean energy initiatives, the government aims to achieve sustainable development while minimizing ecological damage.\n\u201cHowever, the journey towards this future must be inclusive and equitable. We cannot afford to leave anyone behind. As we embrace new technologies and policies, we must ensure that they benefit all segments of society, particularly the most vulnerable.\u201d\n\u201cWe mustprioritize access to clean and affordable energy for remote communities, empowering women and youth in the energy sector, and fostering partnerships that promote capacity building and knowledge transfer.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cA just energy transition demands a holistic approach that integrates energy policy with broader development objectives, including poverty alleviation, job creation, and environmental sustainability.

            "content": "Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia has called on Telecommunication companies operating in the country to move beyond seeking to expand the physical infrastructure of their operations to investing in the human and other resources that are at the heart of their offerings to the Ghanaian and African market.\nSpeaking at the launch of operations for Telecel Ghana, new majority shareholders in the company formerly known as Vodafone Ghana, on Monday, March 11, 2024 Dr Bawumia reminded telcos, fintechs and stakeholders in the technology ecosystem that one of the surest ways of ensuring lasting success is investing in the youth, who are the future of any endeavor.\n\u201cLet me challenge you to look beyond physical infrastructure. Your corporate social responsibility must include a deliberate investment and development of the digital capabilities and capacities of young Ghanaians across the country at all levels. As we celebrate this momentous occasion, remember that you also have a role in shaping the future of our nation,\u201d he reminded them.\nDr Bawumia reminded the leadership of Telecel that innovation is the heartbeat of success in the telecom and indeed the business environment, and challenged them to make a difference in the Ghanaian telcom market with offerings that would make their brand attractive.\n\u201cIn the ever-evolving landscape of technology, innovation is key to staying ahead. Your customers require accessible, safe, affordable, and reliable network always. I am happy about Telecel\u2019s commitment to expand their network and bring more innovation into this space. In that regard, you have the government\u2019s firm support.\nHe continued: \u201cI am also delighted to see the emphasis placed on inclusivity and accessibility in your services. In Ghana, like in many parts of the world, there are still underserved communities with limited access to telecommunications infrastructure. By expanding your reach and investing in infrastructure development, you are not only expanding access to communication but also creating opportunities for economic growth and social empowerment for the underprivileged.\nExtolling the virtues of the introduction and growing use of Mobile Money, Vice President Bawumia urged the management of Telecel to explore the many opportunities available for deepening financial inclusion, saying although much had been done, there was more to do.\nThe value of mobile money transactions as of December 2016 was GH\u00a278.5billion. However, since the introduction of Mobile Money Interoperability between different networks and bank accounts, there has been a very rapid expansion in the volume of transactions. In 2023, mobile money transactions hit a record GHC199.3 trillion, which represents 64.3% increase from the previous year. This has made Ghana the number one country in Africa for financial inclusion, because we have achieved 100% availability and inclusion for every Ghanaian.\u00a0\n\u201cThe opportunities that the Mobile Money platform, backed by the introduction of Mobile Money Interoperability, has created is enormous. I commend your company for the role it has played in the past, but most importantly, I urge you to strive to do more as mobile money is one of the surest ways to promote financial inclusivity.\u201d\nWelcoming the Telecel Group to Ghana with a hearty \u201cAkwaaba\u201d, Dr Bawumia urged them to be worthy partners for national development.\n\u201cI applaud your commitment to corporate social responsibility through the Telecel Foundation and Africa Start-Up Initiative Programme (ASIP). Your initiatives to support education, healthcare, and support for start-ups reflect your dedication to making a meaningful impact beyond business success. This aligns perfectly with our government's vision of building a more equitable and prosperous society for all Ghanaians.\n\u201cAs key players in the telecommunications industry, I urge you to uphold the highest standards of ethics, transparency, and corporate governance in all your endeavours. I have no doubt that this brand will not only thrive but also contribute significantly to the advancement of our nation's telecommunications sector.\u201d\nTelecel Group\nThe Telecel Group acquired Vodafone International\u2019s 70% stake in Ghana Telecom in February 2023, with the Government of Ghana retaining its 30% stake. The two organisations have since been working to synergize their operations, with changes in leadership and operations. Patricia Obo-Nai, first Ghanaian CEO of Vodafone Ghana, has been tapped as the first CEO of Telecel Ghana.\nOperating in over 27 countries, with over six million active subscribers, Telecel aims to digitally empower Africa through technology, connecting remote areas for inclusivity, and focusing on education as a catalyst for growth and accessibility, according to its Board.\nSpeaking at the launch, the Chairman and Co-founder of the Telecel Group, Mr. Nicolas Bourg, said the company intends to focus on \u201cpositive disruption and innovation in the Ghanaian telecoms market,\u201d adding \u201cwe chose to invest in Ghana because of the manifest potential of the youth and people of Ghana.\u201d\nDistributed by APO Group on behalf of The Presidency, Republic of Ghana.",

            "content": "It is always a sight for sore eyes on the offshore assets of Tullow Ghana, in West Africa.\nBeyond the impressive facilities on the FPSOs that produce oil and gas, the most fascinating scene is the strong commitment to local talent and expertise in action. What is often noticeable is that amidst the varying sounds of large-scale equipment and the lingering breeze from the ocean, Ghanaian workers stand shoulder-to-shoulder with their international counterparts, united in their pursuit of excellence.\nAs the global energy demand continues to rise, the role of multinational corporations in shaping the future of oil and gas production cannot be overstated. In Ghana, the emergence of the oil boom close to two decades ago presented both opportunities and challenges. Amidst all these, Tullow Ghana, the main operator of the Jubilee and TEN fields, emerged as a pioneer in promoting local content development, in line with the demands of the petroleum agreement with its host nation.\nSince 2007, Tullow Ghana Limited recognised that sustainable development must match community engagement and empowerment. This led to an active implementation of a solid local content strategy that aimed to maximize the participation of Ghanaians in the upstream sector. Today, this success story continues to be told in transformative ways.\nFor example, more than 70% of Tullow\u2019s workforce for its Ghana operations are locals with 32% ($202m) of the total value of contracts ($619m) awarded in 2023 going to indigenous entities (a 4% increase from 2022). Additionally, $317m worth of contracts were awarded to Joint-Venture companies (part Ghanaian and part foreign ownership) that same year.\nOver the past decade, Tullow has awarded contracts worth $10.7 billion to businesses with significant local participation in the sector.\nAnd that is not all: The company delivered six training workshops through the Petroleum Commission/Tullow Business Academy Partnership initiative last year, strengthening its ties with key external stakeholders. A strong commitment to transparency and collaboration was demonstrated through the successful organisation of four Supplier Market Day events, and the completion of five supplier training programmes across the country. \nA significant milestone in Tullow\u2019s commitment to ethical practices also reflected in the training of 140 suppliers late last year on the importance of safeguarding human rights within the supply chain sector,\n\u201cOur commitment to local content reflects the way we do business in Ghana. Since its inception, Tullow and its partners have delivered close to $7bn in revenues to the Ghana government and invested close to $20bn in the oil and gas sector. Given a consistent enabling environment and respect for the sanctity of contracts and agreements by our host nation, more can be done to make this country an energy sector leader in West Africa,\u201d said Managing Director, Wissam Al-Monthiry.\nTullow Ghana\u2019s intent extends beyond using only local resources, it also strives to build local capability through education, knowledge, and skills transfer. This ensures that the benefits of natural resource development are enjoyed by local communities. In the key parts of Ghana, especially the Western region where its major operations are, Tullow continues to support the local communities through educational infrastructure for secondary schools, scholarships for disadvantaged students and livelihood programmes for the fisherfolk. It is currently investing over $10m in educational infrastructure in key regions in Ghana; making dreams come true for the people.\nLet\u2019s zoom in on Tullow\u2019s recent Jubilee South-East (JSE) Project as another example. This project expanded oil production capacity from 70,000 to 100,000 barrels per day in the Greater Jubilee Field. During the project, it became evident that a local company, Orsam Energies (with a 90% Ghanaian workforce), successfully fabricated one of the world's most complicated subsea equipment for the project at its fabrication yard in Takoradi; a triumph for local capacity development.\nSometime in 2021 as well, Tullow, in true local content fashion, supported and enabled the delivery of Ghana\u2019s first ever wholly-owned sea vessel - the \nMV Flat Confidence\n - which currently supports two FPSO (Floating Production Storage Offloading) assets offshore Ghana. Tullow\u2019s leadership in awarding a contract to Flat C Marine Services \u2013 the owners of the Ghanaian-owned vessel - highlighted the potential of local businesses to thrive in the oil and gas sector, when given the right support.\nAs Ghana continues to navigate the complexities of oil and gas production, the leadership demonstrated by Tullow Ghana Limited in local content development is a blueprint for other industry players to emulate. By making Ghanaians the priority in its operations, Tullow has laid the foundation for a more inclusive and sustainable future. There is more to come. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

So, for instance, it is pervasive to find firms in Ghana\u2019s financial sector giving away jobs usually seeded to agribusiness experts to others with no background in the discipline but would later turn to development partners to train these same employees on how to identify agricultural risks and develop innovative products that lessen risks associated with lending to the sector. I must quickly add that this square-pegs-in-round-holes situation also happens in other sub-sectors that thrive on agribusiness expertise.\n\u201cBut who is better placed to understand and manage the problems and risk factors in the agricultural sector than the agribusiness professional with accumulated theoretical and specialist knowledge?\u201d he said.\nThe virtual launch was under the theme: \u201cRe-defining agribusiness education, research and innovation\u201d.\nIt was attended by representatives of organisations and groups such as Kosmos Innovation Center, Ghana Association of Agricultural Economists (GAAE), International Food and Agribusiness Management (IFAMA) among others.\nHead of KNUST department of agriculture economics, agribusiness and extension, Prof. Fred Nimoh who represented the provost of the KNUST College of Agriculture and Natural Resources charged the organization to churn out innovations to drive the agriculture value chain.\n\u201cAlong the chain we should be able to think through and come out with innovations and address the challenges.\n\u201cAnd we all believe, we\u2019re going to experience a drastic change,\u201d he\u2019s optimistic.",

He expressed hope that it is something families and all attendees will take pride in seeing again.\n\u201cThis year, we are happy to do a GIS adaptation.

We need to be proud of the talents of women and what they can achieve and not use men\u2019s achievements as the yardstick of what women can do,\u201dshe said.\nThe Country Director urged women to strive to become what they set their minds to and stop wasting their time.\nMrs Duti also advised women to guard against the popular saying that \u201cbehind every successful man is a woman\u201d and stop being stuck in their minds to unleash their potential. \nShe noted that such sayings put women in the shadows of men and indicate their place as being behind the success of men.\n\u201cAs women, you are not only there to support the success of men, but you are also capable of achieving your own success and you are encouraged to do so\u201d, she said.\nOther dignitaries at the event included the Managing Director of GWCL, Professor Benedicta Fosu-Mensah and Dr Rita Boateng of the University of Ghana, the General Manager for Finance and Administration and other Chief Managers of GWCL who took turns to address the women at the function.\nThe Network of Professional Women in Water, Sanitation and Hygiene, known as WiWASH, is the Ghana Chapter of the Women\u2019s Caucus of the Africa Water and Sanitation Association (AfWASA). It is a platform for the exchange of experiences, good practices and capacity building among members, for the improvement of the water, sanitation and hygiene sector.\nWiWASH was officially launched at the Alisa Hotel in Accra Ghana on July 13, 2017.\nMembership of the Network is open to women researchers, engineers, technicians, administrative officers and all other professional women in the WASH sector.",

It could not have been true, as stated in the Press Release from the Ghana Armed Forces, that 'there are ongoing discussions by a Committee set up by the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources to deliberate and recommend possible measures to resolve the fond issue.\"\nOn the back of this, the coalition is accusing the Ghana Armed Forces of disregarding established agreements and acting in bad faith by feigning ignorance of these negotiations.\n\"The Ghana Armed Forces cannot pretend not to be aware of the deliberations and documentation executed in respect of the land,\" Portions of the March 13, 2024 statement indicated read.\nThey emphasised the importance of respecting the rights of the La Stool for peaceful coexistence and called for adherence to the law in resolving the ongoing land dispute.\nCOLA expects the Ghana Armed Forces will act fairly and in accordance with the law.\nThey insisted that any action to the contrary would be deemed unlawful and could lead to chaos.",

Once you have set this goal you need to know the rules,\u201d she added.\nShe also said: \u201cIf don\u2019t attend so many social activities, you can do lots of thinking, you can think through and make decisions that will propel your business, and do your planning inside and set your agenda.\u201d\nShe said women must also not lose sight of the fact that they are not just women but mothers, and for that matter must strive to be that good woman for the family, and for that man to lean on and ensure progress and make the family prosperous.",
